Epsilon Max Steps   & $10^5$        &Steps until epsilon reaches minimum        
Epsilon End   & 0.05        &Minimum epsilon value   
Memory Size  & $10^64$

fix:
	Linh:
		- classical trj in ur5 ?
		- dates, conf, place
	

	- mirror ur5 images
	- all figure refs

	- check related works
	- add laser images of kuka and ur5
	- include newly found related works
	- Experiment
	yifan:
		- pb background, coordinates
		- modifications on ur5
	
related work:
	- static sensors: blind spot, obstcl outside occlusion
	- IR proximity ?
conclusion:
	- end to end pose (more specific applc)
